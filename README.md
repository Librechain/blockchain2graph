Blockchain2graph extract informations from the bitcoin blockchain and insert them into a neo4j graph database. 

Here are some use cases : 
* Query blockchain data with the [cypher query language](https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher-query-language/).
* Build web sites like [Blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info/).
* Add meta informations to addresses and transactions.

At [Blockchain Inspector](http://www.blockchaininspector.com/), we are using Artificial Intelligence to fight fraud in the Blockchain and we needed to have a convenient way to access blockchain informations. With blockchain2graph, we can analyse blockchain data as transactions between nodes and add meta informations on them.

The documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/straumat/blockchain2graph/wiki).
